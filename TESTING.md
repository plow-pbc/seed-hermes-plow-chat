# Testing

## Maintainer checks

```bash
just test
```

Equivalent direct commands:

```bash
ref/verify.sh
uvx pytest -q
```

These checks prove the direct-mounted file set is complete, `config.yaml`
enables `plow-chat-platform`, host helper scripts are syntax-valid, the adapter
shape is intact, and committed files do not contain literal Plow secrets or
real activation codes.

## Container plugin-load check

From a disposable Hermes host folder:

```bash
mkdir -p hermes-agent/data
PLOW_CHAT_PLUGIN_LOCAL_DIR=/path/to/seed-hermes-plow-chat \
  ref/scripts/install_direct_mount.sh --scaffold ./hermes-agent
cat >> hermes-agent/data/.env <<'EOF'
PLOW_CHAT_BASE_URL=https://api.plow.co
PLOW_CHAT_CHAT_UID=cht_dummy_for_load_check
PLOW_CHAT_TOKEN=dummy_for_load_check
PLOW_CHAT_HOME_CHANNEL=cht_dummy_for_load_check
EOF
docker compose up
```

Expected evidence:

- Hermes discovers and enables manifest `plow-chat-platform`.
- Gateway logs show platform `plow_chat` registered.
- No `ImportError` references `ref/hermes-plugin/plow_chat/adapter.py`.

The dummy token is only for import/load verification. The WebSocket ticket
request may fail later because the chat credentials are not real.

## Live Plow verification run

```bash
mkdir -p hermes-agent/data
PLOW_CHAT_PLUGIN_LOCAL_DIR=. ref/scripts/install_direct_mount.sh --scaffold ./hermes-agent
ref/scripts/create_plow_chat_curl.sh --scaffold ./hermes-agent
```

The script asks Plow to assign a line. Use `--base-url` only if you are
targeting a non-production Plow API.

Text the printed `Plow Activate: ABCDE` message from iMessage to the printed
Plow line. The host script should report:

```text
Status: pending
Status: verified
Verified: chat is active.
```

Then start Hermes:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Expected Hermes evidence:

- A normal reply from iMessage is delivered to Hermes as a `plow_chat` inbound
  message.

If the poll times out, start activation again. Common causes are the code
expiring, texting from the wrong messaging identity, or texting the wrong line.
